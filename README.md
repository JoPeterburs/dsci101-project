# dsci101-project

This repository stores my DSCI 101 final project from Spring 2023. In this project, I explored basic questions about the March Machine Learning Madness dataset from Kaggle. I looked at both men's and women's data.

The five questions I asked about the data:

1. What team has the most average wins per season for their time as a D1 team since 2003? (Separate answers for men and women).

2. My dad always says that free throws win games. Does the team that makes more free throws (by number and by %) in an individual game typically win? In other words, what is the probability that a team wins an individual game given that they made more free throws (count and percentage)?
  
  - Plot FT percentage and winning percentage on a scatter plot. Facet by year and color-code if the team made the March Madness tournament.

3. Was there a difference in score, fouls, assists, and three point shooting percentage by conference in the 21-22 season? Plot each element on sied-by-side boxplots to compare conferences.

4. Which team is more likely to win an overtime game during the regular season (home or away)?

5. What is the lowest seed to have won the championship game? What about getting to the Final Four?

Extra: Compare freethrow percentages between years. Has the average freethrow percentage increased, decreased, or stayed about the same?
